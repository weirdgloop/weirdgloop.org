# Contact

If you'd like to get in touch with us about hosting a wiki, or if you're looking for general advice about using the MediaWiki software, then you can contact us by emailing `admin@weirdgloop.org`.

If you prefer, we're also on <span class="discord">![Discord](/images/discord.svg) Discord</span> - you can reach out to Jonathan Lee with your queries by sending a friend request to `cookmeplox`.

## Account related questions

If you have a query about your account on one of our hosted wikis, you can contact us by clicking **Contact Weird Gloop** in the footer of the wiki page. We'll respond as soon as possible!
