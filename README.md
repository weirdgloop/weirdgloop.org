# weirdgloop.org

This repository contains the source code that is used to build the Weird Gloop [website](http://weirdgloop.org). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which means that editing and creating pages on the site is as simple as changing Markdown files. The configuration for the site is stored in `_config.yml`.

Commits pushed to the `master` branch are deployed using GitHub Pages, available at https://weirdgloop.org.

### How to run locally

1. Install Jekyll and its prerequisites ([see here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/))
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the site locally
